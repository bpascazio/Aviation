# EFIS Systems

An EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System) is a modern avionics system that displays flight data electronically rather than using traditional mechanical gauges. It typically includes:

1) Primary Flight Display (PFD): Shows critical flight information such as attitude, altitude, airspeed, and heading.
2) Multi-Function Display (MFD): Displays navigation, weather, engine data, and other system information.
3) Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS): Monitors and displays engine performance and alerts the crew to any issues.

EFIS systems improve situational awareness, reduce pilot workload, and enhance flight safety by integrating multiple data sources into a cohesive display.
