## Glasair Aviation: A Legacy of Innovation in Experimental Aircraft

Glasair Aviation has been a pioneering force in the experimental amateur-built aircraft industry since 1980. The introduction of the Glasair marked a revolution as the first pre-molded composite kitplane. Since then, over 2500 kits have been built, with more than 1200 actively flying across numerous countries.

### Evolution and Models

The original Glasair series I, II, and III underwent continuous improvements from 1980 to 1995. In 1997, Glasair introduced the GlaStar, a versatile high-wing design. The GlaStar further evolved into the popular Sportsman, known for its speed, range, and rugged construction suitable for both cross-country flights and off-airport operations.

### Two Weeks to Taxi Program

In 2006, Glasair launched the "Two Weeks to Taxi" program, an aircraft builder-assist program. This program allows builders to construct an airworthy Sportsman aircraft in just two weeks with the help of Glasair's professionals, offering a unique hands-on experience and familiarity with their new aircraft.

### Acquisition and Future Plans

In 2012, Glasair Aviation was acquired by the Jilin Hanxing Group of China. This acquisition has supported Glasair's role as a design and development resource in the global market. Currently, Glasair is undergoing a certification project for the Sportsman, which aims to broaden its distribution opportunities worldwide.

### Performance and Certifications

While specific performance metrics vary by model (Glasair, GlaStar, Sportsman), Glasair aircraft are known for their speed, range, and versatility. The Sportsman, in particular, is designed for both on-airport and off-airport operations. Glasair is currently working on certification for the Sportsman model.

Glasair Aviation remains dedicated to providing innovative, high-performance aircraft, emphasizing quality and value for pilots worldwide.

Glasair Aviation holds several notable certifications and is involved in ongoing certification processes:

1. **Merlin Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA) Certification**: On March 29, 2016, Glasair Aviation received FAA certification for its Merlin LSA, marking the company's first entry into turnkey airplane production. This certification is significant as it allows Glasair to produce and sell a fully assembled aircraft, rather than just kits[1].

2. **Planned Certification for the Sportsman**: In 2017, Glasair announced plans to apply for Part 23 certification for its popular Sportsman model. This certification would enable the Sportsman to be sold as a fully certified aircraft, expanding its market reach beyond the experimental amateur-built category[2].

Glasair Aviation is known for its innovative designs and high-performance aircraft, and these certifications reflect the company's efforts to expand its offerings into the certified aircraft market.
