The ICON A5 is a revolutionary amphibious aircraft designed for adventure and versatility, offering a unique blend of performance, safety, and accessibility. This two-seat aircraft is equipped with a 100-horsepower Rotax 912 engine, providing a top speed of 95 knots (176 km/h), a range of 427 nautical miles (791 km), and a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 686 kg (1,513 lbs). It features folding wings for easy storage, Garmin avionics, and a whole-airframe parachute system for added safety[2][4][6].

### Certifications
The ICON A5 has achieved significant milestones in certification. Initially categorized as a Light Sport Aircraft (LSA) by the FAA in 2015, the A5 required a weight waiver to comply with LSA regulations. In December 2023, the aircraft received FAA Type Certification in the Primary Category. This certification allows the A5 to be sold and registered internationally without requiring weight waivers, facilitating its entry into markets in Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America. The Type Certification also underscores the aircraft's compliance with stringent design and manufacturing standards[3][4][6].

### Market Impact
The Type Certification positions ICON Aircraft to expand globally, meeting international demand and enabling easier operation in countries that do not recognize the LSA category. The Certified Edition of the A5 is built under stricter FAA oversight compared to its LSA counterpart but retains identical performance specifications. While the Certified Edition requires a private pilot certificate with a seaplane rating, the LSA version can be operated with a sport pilot certificate and seaplane endorsement[1][4][6].

With its innovative design and expanded certifications, the ICON A5 continues to set new standards in recreational aviation, appealing to both adventure enthusiasts and general aviation pilots worldwide.
