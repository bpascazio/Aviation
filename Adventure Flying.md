# Adventure Flying

This is something I came up with. It's the concept of connecting general aviation with more exotic adventures. While local flying within one's own country is exciting enough and provides many learning and fun times I asked myself what's next.

Adventure flying is all about seeking out exotic destinations and flying there. It could be either between ICAO member states or traveling to a destination and getting behind the stick of some Aircraft.
