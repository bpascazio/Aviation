Here are all my research notes on Aviation. I'm using GitHub so eventually I can create a markdown docs site
and share the information on the internet.

The information is separated into:

Lists - lists of airplanes, engines, radios, ...
Topics - adevntury flying, aircraft maintenance, rules and regulations, ...
