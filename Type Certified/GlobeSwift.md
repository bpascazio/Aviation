## Globe Swift: History, Ownership, and Performance

### **History and Development**
The Globe Swift, a low-wing, two-seat monoplane, was designed by R.S. "Pop" Johnson in 1940 in Fort Worth, Texas. Initially conceived as a homebuilt aircraft, it was inspired by the Culver Cadet. Johnson reverse-engineered the Cadet to create a more advanced design. The first Swift prototype featured a tube-and-fabric fuselage with Duraloid wings and tail surfaces. The Globe Aircraft Corporation, formed in 1941 from the Bennett Aircraft Corporation, took over its production after World War II restrictions were lifted[3][4][5].

The first production model, the GC-1A Swift, debuted in 1945 with an 85-hp engine. However, its performance was underwhelming, leading to the introduction of the GC-1B Swift in 1946, equipped with a more powerful 125-hp engine. Despite initial success and high demand, Globe Aircraft faced financial difficulties due to overproduction and a post-war aviation market glut. By 1947, Globe filed for bankruptcy, and its assets were acquired by TEMCO (Texas Engineering & Manufacturing Company), which continued producing the Swift until 1951[3][4][6].

### **Type Certificate Ownership**
The Swift Museum Foundation, based in Athens, Tennessee, currently owns the type certificate for the Globe Swift. This organization provides ongoing support for maintaining and restoring these vintage aircraft[2].
